# x68000-Atx-Psu-Inverter
You will want to build this to convert your Sharp x68000 to be able to use a modern ATX PSU


Refer to YouTube video on more details: https://youtu.be/1u4BrF8XW6E


You need only 4 connections to this, 5v (from the permament standby logic circuit), GND, the PS-ON From the Sharp x68000 and the PS-ON from the ATX PSU

Note: If you are removing the ATX cables completely, ensure that you solder 3v3 sense wire on your PSU (this usually goes to the ATX connector and is spliced to the 3v3 line) directly to the 3v3 on the ATX PSU itself, otherwise the PSU will shut down after a second when you power it up.

Have fun and be careful!!
